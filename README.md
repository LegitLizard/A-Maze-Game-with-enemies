# 2D Maze Game

This project was created to provide a friend with a platform to showcase his in-game artwork to potential clients, while also being a challenging and engaging learning exercise for me.

# Features:
- **Maze Generation**: A modified version of Prim's algorithm creates randomised mazes for the player to traverse, while ensuring a unique experience with every attempt
- **Enemy AI**: Enemies are programmed to chase the player, increasing the difficulty and excitement
- **Maze Solving**: A variation of Dijkstra's algorithm, the Breadth First Search, is used to dynamically solve the maze if the player is stuck and can't find the exit. It traverses the maze and then recurisvely determines the correct path, which is then overlayed onto the mazee.

# Running the project:
- Launch the file [Final Code.exe](Final%20Code.exe)
- Press the play button
- Use the arrow keys to navigate the maze
- Press x to solve the maze
